# ABC-Laboratory
ABC-Laboratory is a prototypical simulation software calculating the fluorescence or absorption of different 'biomolecules'. 
It uses the Godot Game Engive (v.3) and is the result of the Bachelor Hands-on / internship during the winter semester 2017/2018 
at TU Darmstadt, Germany. 

# How to use the source code or even the software
Currently, you can only clone this repository and import it in the Godot Game Engine (v3) by yourself. I am going to provide a downloadable
.exe to execute the simulation directly on your local machine.

# What is the goal?
From now on, I am neither working in the team from the beginning nor am I working for Katja Schmitz or Kai Hamacher.
So I am going to fix some bug fixes and provide some more essential features. 
Here is an example: 
Using the parameter csv files to read the parameter from the biomolecules, buffer and the reagent and the ability to add more biomolecules, ...

Furthermore, I am going the improve the designs of the software. May be I am going to do a 3D environment and we use a 2D navigation 
to interact. 

Do you have any suggestion for improvement, questions, feedback or issues? Don't hesitate to contact me!
